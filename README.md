Please read the entire document before submitting your repo.

## Aim

This lab is meant to get students more accustomed to the technologies used in designing and implementing an HTML frontend application and RESTful API server.

## Requirements

Now that the backend server has been fully implemented, now all that's left is to to design and implement a user friendly GUI (graphical user interface) for the tank management application.

This version of the frontend app should act as a mock-up to show what the final application could look like. Consider it a first draft. 

**HTML and CSS**

The objective is to design an appropriate card design in HTML. These cards should be designed to display all the attributes of each tank object and the user profile object.

The HTML layout of a tank object can as simple or as complex a design as desired, as long as it makes sense. That being said, it should be known that you will not be graded on aesthetics or visual appearance. Full marks will be awarded as long as all requirements are met.

Your design should display at least 4 tank cards.

Add a suitable header to the top of you web app to display the name of the system. The name of the application is up to you.

Use CSS to style your user card and tank cards and the page header.

Your HTML and CSS code must be written in their own separate files.

- index.html
- style.css

Any other media (eg. images, etc.) that need to be included should be stored in a folder called `assets`.

## Submission

Your code should be uploaded to your GitHub account.

The repo should be called "ECSE3038_lab5".

You should include a [README.md](http://readme.md/) file that describes the purpose of the application.

Due date is Sunday, March 6, 2022 at 11:59PM.
